# Visit Monterey

Simple guide to Monterey

## Where to stay

Cheap:
* camping: this is right in town, a bit odd but, super cheap [https://www.monterey.org/Services/Parks-and-Beaches/Camping-and-Hiking](https://www.monterey.org/Services/Parks-and-Beaches/Camping-and-Hiking)
* right in town, good wifi: this is right in downtown Monterey, walk to all the shops/restaurants, about 10 minutes from the bay/ocean (Fisherman's Warf) [https://www.thestevensonmonterey.com/](https://www.thestevensonmonterey.com/)
* on the beach (in Pacific Grove): across from the beach, walk to shops in PG in 5 minutes, walk to aquarium in 10. [https://www.loverspointinnpg.com/](https://www.loverspointinnpg.com/)

Big Sur: you need to reserve stuff here (especially camping) WAY in advance. And it's all expensive. I just illegally camp most of the time.

Expensive: 
* on the tourist strip, near the best restaurants in Monterey, rooms hanging over the water... very posh: https://montereyplazahotel.com/

Carmel:
Carmel is expensive... I've never staid anywhere there but everything is pretty sweet. Parking is a nightmare so maybe find a place that solves that. 

## What to do

Ocean, ocean, ocean... plus - the hills are gorgeous (Carmel Valley) too. 

### Monterey

Monterey is a working class town with a bunch of colleges, mostly military - it's an odd scene and mix of super hippy and not-hippy-at-all. The "real" town reflects this so there's not much besides the beach. It's an incredibly beautiful area but Monterey itself is non-spectacular (but doesn't suck). The tourist part of Monterey (Fishman's Warf, "Skid" row (Aquarium), etc) are SF Fisherman's Warf level touristy but have a few good restaurants (some world reknwown).

Monterey has two main areas

#### Downtown Monterey

"Downtown" is a small, semi historic area with some good restaurants but nothign to write home about. See `Restaurants` below for tips. 

Map: [https://tinyurl.com/tsogep6](https://tinyurl.com/tsogep6)

You can't really see the ocean from here, and the entire area can be walked in 15 minutes. The main restaurant/shop street is on `Alvarado St`. 

`Pacific and Jefferson` has the "historic" area. 

#### Tourist Monterey

Tourist Monterey is REALLY tourist... like theme park level... :( That said... it's broken up into 3 main areas - all connected with bike paths and easily walkable:

* Fisherman's Warf: Features the marina, a few OK restaurants, a ridiculously long beach that stretches all the way to Santa Cruz (the entire Monterey Bay), kayak rentals and parking.
* Old Fisherman's Warf: Beyond tourist hell but this is where you can come for whale watching, sailboat trips, fishing trips, and a bunch of restaurants overlooking the harbor (all middle of the road and over priced). There's also an OK Salvador Dali Musuem here.
* Cannery Row: Again - Beyond touristy (Buba Gub Shrimp stupidity level). Best place for soveneirs, better restaurants than Old Fisherman's Warf, and close to a few great ones. The main reason to come here is **[The Monterey Bay Aquarium](https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/)** (see note below). 

**[The Monterey Bay Aquarium](https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/)** This, imo, is a MUST visit. It's an AMAZING place. I have a year round pass and still go at least once a month. On the weekends it's a mob scene, and kid hell... STILL WORTH IT. The Jelly Fish exhibit is one of the coolest things ever. The lines, on the weekends, to get tickets can be an hour+... so, if you're going, buy tickets ON LINE .. skip the line, and just pick them up inside (it's not obvious, but there are tons of volunteers working - just ask one of them)

#### Hopkins Cove and Lover's Point - Monterey/Pacific Grove

There's a bike path that you can walk between The Monterey Bay Aquarium and Lover's Point... this is a great, short walk, that's absolutely gorgeous. On the walk you'll pass Hopkins Cove. 

Hopkins Cove: This the local breeding beach for seals. Cuteness overload. DO NOT WALK ON THE BEACH OR PASS THE FENCE (we're semi-psycho about this down here - someone will tackle you :)... Seal mothers abandon their pups at the first sign of danger and never come back... but, you can see them through the fence and if you have some `binoculars` even better. They even have their own FB group [https://www.facebook.com/HarborSealsOfPacificGrove/](https://www.facebook.com/HarborSealsOfPacificGrove/)

Eventually you'll hit Lover's Point. This is the best place for Sunrise photos. When the surf's up it's got a great break. "Downtown" Pacific Grove is just up the hill - cute, but totally skipable. Snorkeling here is amazing on good viz days.

## Ocean Drive (Pacific Grove/Monterey)

Map: [https://tinyurl.com/rzsjgq8](https://tinyurl.com/rzsjgq8)

This < 5 mile drive is why I live here. Tons of pull outs to park and just watch the ocean. It's exposed to nearly every Western Wave angle so you can always find some nice waves. Has one huge beach (Asilomar), walking trails right on the cliffs/shore, AMAZING sunsets, bike lanes, it's the best place in California :) 

## 17 Mile Drive (Pacific Grove/Pebble Beach/Carmel)

Map: [https://tinyurl.com/tpn8c94](https://tinyurl.com/tpn8c94)

This is a `gated` community that charges you $10 to get in... it's full of rich fucking wankers and golf tossers and IT'S FUCKING GORGEOUS.

It's more amazing coastal driving with pull outs. Scattered along the 10 mile drive are super fancy restaurants, shops, golf courses, etc. It runs from Pacific Grove to Carmel. It's kind of a must-do. 

## Carmel

Carmel is the rich part of "Monterey Bay". The VERY rich part. It's got AMAZING restaurants (even a few Michelin Stars). The whole town looks like a fucking Thomas Kincaid painting strewn with botiques and Rolex stores. It's a bit Disney World ... but, is super nice. The town beach is gorgeous. If you find the "dive bar" it's a fun place to listen for an hour to the locals. It's got the best pizza on the pennisula. And it's the gateway to Big Sur. Across the "highway" (68/1) is an amazing French bakery. 

## Carmel Valley

Map: [https://tinyurl.com/tdqro7g](https://tinyurl.com/tdqro7g)

This is the wine/hill area of Monterey Pennisula (Carmel). Lots of wineries, a few great spas, an amazing [motorcycle museum](http://www.mototalbott.com/) (seriously recommend) and, a nice, much warmer drive.

The valley road goes all the way to Rt 1 and just gets prettier and prettier. There is some easy off road off the main road with hiking. Even some camping. 

Not a "must see" but - interesting if you have time.

## Laguna Seca (race track)

World reknown race track with the infamous Cork Screw. Super fun place to see a race. The motorcycle cycle races are particularly insane but they do a lot of vintage racing too which is fun. You can walk around the pits and get close up to the cars. I'm not even into racing but I like the place. 

One other cool thing about this track it has miles of hiking trails with great views. And bars at the top of the hills :)

You can usually camp here as well if you want. Kind of a fun party most weekends.

## Point Lobos State Park

Map: [https://tinyurl.com/uqxmkxc](https://tinyurl.com/uqxmkxc)

This is my favorite park in CA. It's a zoo on the weekends but you can walk in from the road (about an hour to the coast). 

The hikes along the coast here are unbelievable... easily the best coastal views I've seen on the planet. Don't miss the Cyprus Grove area of the park if you go - it's the best part. 

## Big Sur

**GAS** FILL UP before leaving Carmel or Cambria!!! There is gas on the drive but, only 2 places and they're not always open. 

This is the whole reason to come south of San Francisco. It's a 2.5 hour drive one way and it's the prettiest drive in California - and that ranking has A LOT of competition. 

So much to do on this drive. Hiking, resorts, backpacking, surfing, free-diving, wildlife, etc. Tons of sites cover this better. 

Insider tip: for an amazing drink and an OK lunch right on the cliffs don't miss [http://www.rockypointrestaurant.com/](http://www.rockypointrestaurant.com/)

If you drive all the way south and want to get back to 101 check out Naciemento Road... fun way to get back to the highway.  Map: [https://tinyurl.com/rtaqp4l](https://tinyurl.com/rtaqp4l)

# Restaurants

I don't eat out very often (x-chef) but these would be my recommendations:

* **Carmel** [Vesuvio](http://chefpepe.com/restaurants/vesuvio/) - amazing pizza, fun roof top bar, mid range price. 
* **Carmel** [California Hotel](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alysonkrueger/2017/03/24/this-california-hotel-holds-a-secret-happy-hour-where-drinks-cost-ten-cents/#6d263c3e39bc) 10 CENT drinks for 10 minutes on Sunday @ 5:30. Pretty stupid - but fun.
* **Carmel** [Lafayette Bakery](https://lafayette-bakery.com/) best French Bakery for hundreds of miles. On Saturdays (only) they have these amazing French pizza things as well. Right near a grocery store as well.
* **PG** [Fish Wife](http://fishwife.com/) Popular seafood joint within walking distance of the beach.
* **PG** [Red House Cafe](http://www.redhousecafe.com/) Best breakfast in the area
* **Monterey** [The Whaling Station](https://thewhalingstation.com/) Best steak in town... a bit highend
* **Monterey** [The Sardine Factory](http://sardinefactory.com/) Best wine list in town... the guy who set the wine room up was America's first sommelier. Very fancy place. 
* **Monterey** [Heriloom Pizza](https://heirloompizzapie.com/) Best deep dish outside of Chicago - absolutely amazing deep dish pizza.

# Getting here from San Francisco

If you just want to get here - Google map it.. but, yawn.

There are two main ways to avoid highway hell getting here from San Francisco. 

## Ocean Route

Map: [https://tinyurl.com/qnxsd3h](https://tinyurl.com/qnxsd3h) ... only adds 20 minutes or so, is gorgeous, tons of beach pull outs, a bunch of small towns with restaurants, goes through Santa Cruz

## Mountain Route

Map: [https://tinyurl.com/qnbu43d](https://tinyurl.com/qnbu43d) This adds over an hour but is driving paradise. Tons of twisty roads, Redwood forests (with hiking), quirky small towns, really fun. 

On the weekends don't miss [Alice's](http://www.alicesrestaurant.com/) ... ok food/booze but, on the weekends, every amazing car in area goes there... it's super car/bike porn heaven and is worth sitting there for an hour watching the shenanigans.
